# Optimization of Magnetic Reference Layer Design in Polarized Neutron Reflectometry


## Repo structure 

The structure here is going to be a problem class, where all the functions are defined and TSF etc are defined with all parameters, then ill have a solver class that takes in the problem class and finds the optimum for the parameters.
