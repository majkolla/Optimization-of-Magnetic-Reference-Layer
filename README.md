## Optimzation problem 
There may be multiple configurations that returns similar results, thus getting the *best* configurations is about finding a configurations that does more than simply perform well with some metric. We may have errors in construction, we may have stability or robustness problems. 

For problem defintion *base1* we have:

${\rm TSF}(x_{\text{CoTi}},\; d_{\text{MRL}},\; c)\\$
s.t.
$\\x_{\text{CoTi}}\in [0,1]$, $d_{\text{MRL}} > 0$, $c\in{\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3,\;
\text{SiO}_2,\text{Au}}$.
