# Meeting 1

### Limits 
- Si substrate is must 
- 200-300 NM 
- Roughness should be as smooth as possible (*why? Is this always true*)
- Stable capping layer



### Goals simplified 
- Thickness of MRL
- material of capping layer 
- thickness of capping layer 

*extra*
- concentration of Co-Ti
- better materials than Co-Ti
- reference layer? (for non polizerar thing so we dont need no magnetic stuff)


- Figure of merit
