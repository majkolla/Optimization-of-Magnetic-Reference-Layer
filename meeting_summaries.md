# Meeting 1

### Limits 
- Si substrate is must 
- 200-300 NM 
- Roughness should be as smooth as possible (*why? Is this always true*)
- Stable capping layer


### Goals simplified 
- Thickness of MRL
- material of capping layer 
- thickness of capping layer 

*extra*
- concentration of Co-Ti
- better materials than Co-Ti
- reference layer? (for non polizerar thing so we dont need no magnetic stuff)


- Figure of merit 

# Meeting 2 
- Get the exact numbers from Anton 
- test and see if we get same plots 
- implement very simple rough draft of a solver 
    - see if we can get .73 
- run it on parameters of itnerest



# Meeting 3

MAKE SURE ALL THOSE WORK

- Compare reflectivity genx vs mine 
- Compare senstiviet genx vs mine 
- check paper stats and compare
