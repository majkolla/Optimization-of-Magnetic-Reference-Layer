\section*{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the phase problem 
    \item Why is the reflectivity is governed by SLD variations at interfaces
    \item How exactly does the spin dependent scattering give us a better picture and why. 
    \item Understand the problem of overshadowing that occurs when using FE 
    \item Why exactly is Co-Ti a good material 
    \item How to model the maximization of the influence of SOI on the reflectivity diff between spin channels. 
    \item How do we model the capping layer material
    \item what does it mean that the roughness is included as Gaussian damping at interfaces.
    \item What does it mean that a neutron spin is parallel or anti-parallel?
\end{itemize}
